   <h1 align="center"> Doppler effect</h1>
   <hr>

   <p id="1">The Doppler effect (or the Doppler shift) is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to observer who is moving relative to the wave source. <br> 
   It is named after the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, who described the phenomenon in 1842. </p>

    <figcaption>Change of wavelength caused by motion of the source.</figcaption>
    </figure>
	
   <p> A common example of Doppler shift is the change of pitch heard when a vehicle sounding a horn approaches and recedes from an observer. 
   Compared to the emitted frequency, the received frequency is higher during the approach, identical at the instant of passing by, and lower during the recession. </p>
   
   <p>The reason for the Doppler effect is that when the source of the waves is moving towards the observer, each successive wave crest is emitted from a position closer to the observer than the previous wave.
   Therefore, each wave takes slightly less time to reach the observer than the previous wave.
   Hence, the time between the arrival of successive wave crests at the observer is reduced, causing an increase in the frequency. 
   While they are traveling, the distance between successive wave fronts is reduced, so the waves "bunch together". 
   Conversely, if the source of waves is moving away from the observer, each wave is emitted from a position farther from the observer than the previous wave, so the arrival time between successive waves is increased, reducing the frequency.
   The distance between successive wave fronts is then increased, so the waves "spread out". </p>

   <h3> Fascinating facts about the speed of sound </h3>
   <hr>
   <ol type="1">
   <li>The Doppler Effect is the change in the perceived frequency of sound waves. If the source of a sound and the listener are standing still, the sound waves are emitted in uniform concentric circles. 
   But if the source moves toward the listener, the waves reaching the listener are closer together, and the listener hears a higher frequency. </li>
   <br/>
   <li> Why is light so much faster than sound? Light is an electromagnetic wave, and its photons can move as a wave through air or as particles through a vacuum. Sound, however, is a pressure wave, which must produce a vibration to be heard. 
   That can only occur when the wave encounters a particle of some kind, such as an air molecule. </li>
   <br/>
   <li>Speed of sound through most solids: 5,960 m/s (13,332 mph).</li>
   <br/>
   <li>When an aircraft travels through air at less than the speed of sound, about 770 mph, the sound waves it produces propagate ahead of it. 
   But when it travels at supersonic speed, the distance between sound waves decreases to nothing, and they combine to create a sonic boom. </li>
   <br/>
   <li>An echo, or reflection, occurs when sound waves bounce off a surface. A ship in a fog can avoid running into cliffs by sounding a foghorn and waiting for the echo. 
   If the time delay is, say, 1.5 seconds, and using 330 m/s as the speed of sound, the ship would be about 250 meters from the cliffs. </li>
   <br/>
   <li>You can't see around a corner because light waves don't bend. But you can hear around a corner because of wave diffraction: 
   If the wavelength of a wave is similar to the size of an object, it bends around it and spreads out as it passes. </li>
